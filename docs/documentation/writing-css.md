# Writing CSS

CSS used in the prototype kit is written in the SCSS syntax of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax). 

## Sass

Sass is an extension of CSS that gives a load of extra features useful in producing CSS for the mass of different devices and browsers. 

SCSS was chosen because you can paste CSS into it without breaking it which is useful for prototyping. Using SCSS means you can also use the [govuk_frontend_toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) Sass libraries which include styles for colours, typography, cross-browser fixes and other things which are used across GOV.UK.
